## Tasks

Family members can assign **tasks** to each other, which have a deadline and can be assigned to one family member or the whole family.
For common recurring tasks (such as household tasks), each member can save presets to quicky assign them again in the future.

## Events

Families can create **events** for certain occasions, holidays and meetings.
The events will be displayed on the **family schedule** and are accessible to all family members.
Events can be recurring (such as weekend dinners), and can be assigned different participants and colors.

## Dashboard

The **dashboard** is where general data about the family is presented.
Here, each family member will be able to see each of the family member's status, the nearest upcoming birthday and which tasks they were assigned.
